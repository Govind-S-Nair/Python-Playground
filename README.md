# Python-Playground

## About:
This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly code projects for those new to programming with Python. As a fellow beginner, I created these projects to help me learn the basics of Python and wanted to share them with other beginners as well. Each project includes code examples and a brief description, which should be useful to those who want to try them out on their own

## Programs:
### 1. Hangman Game
This simple yet addictive game uses ASCII to bring the game to life. But instead of random words, the word dictionary includes terminologies from computer science, challenging your knowledge of programming concepts while having fun.
### 2. Password Generator
This Python password generator allows you to create passwords of any length you want. You can also customize your password with numbers and special characters for added security.
