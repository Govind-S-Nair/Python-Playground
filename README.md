# Python-Playground

## About:
Welcome to my repository of fun Python projects for beginners! I created this repository to store the code for some of the projects I worked on when I was learning Python programming. These projects helped me practice different aspects of Python, such as working with strings, lists, loops and functions. I'm sharing these projects with the hope that they will be useful to other beginners who are also learning Python.

## Prerequisites:
To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. Some basic knowledge of Python programming will also be helpful, including understanding of variables, data types, control structures, functions, and loops. You can use any development environment or Python IDE of your choice to run the code. The good news is that all the necessary code and resources are included in the repository. With these prerequisites met, you should be able to easily run and experiment with the Python code in this repository.

## Programs:
### 1. Simple Calculator
This simple calculator project is an excellent starting point for beginners to learn concepts such as user input, function definitions, and conditional statements. 
### 2. Password Generator
This Python password generator allows you to create passwords of any length you want. You can also customize your password with numbers and special characters for added security.
### 3. Hangman Game
This simple yet addictive game uses ASCII to bring the game to life. But instead of random words, the word dictionary includes terminologies from computer science, challenging your knowledge of programming concepts while having fun.
### 4. Contact Book
This is a simple program designed to manage a list of contacts. Users can add new contacts, search for existing contacts, display all contacts, edit existing contacts, and delete existing contacts.
